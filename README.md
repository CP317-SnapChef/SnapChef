## What is SnapChef?
SnapChef is a mobile application for IOS and Android that gives you recipes with the available ingredients you have on hand. The base model will only search a database using either pictures of ingredients, their barcodes, or the name of the ingredients. In a later implementation it may include users uploading recipes, however that is not our current focus.

## Base Model
Base Model:

- Search by text
- Create and populate database
- Setup and connect backend
- Design

We are aiming to have the base model done by **November 16th 2018 @ 11:59**

## Future Implementation
Functions to be later implemented (in order of priority):
1. Search by barcode
2. Machine learning (search by picture)

Deadlines for these features will be added at a later time.
