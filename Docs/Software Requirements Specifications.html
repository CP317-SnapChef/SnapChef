Introduction 
The purpose of this document is outline the requirements for SnapChef. The document will describe the features of the app. The intended audience is project team and David Brown. The document will also be useful to our classmates and those who take the class in the future.

1.2 Scope
The general aim will be towards those who are unfamiliar with cooking or want to expand their horizons in cooking by finding new uses for different ingredients. Students especially may gain quick cooking experience and understanding through this app. The recipes available will be sorted or restricted by budget and/or servings to allow easier use. Those who have interesting or original recipes, will be able to share on a message board feature.

1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviation
API: Application Program Interface. External software containing sets of routines, protocols, and tools for building software.

GUI: Graphical User Interface. Type of interface that allows users to interact with electronics and software.

SRS: Software Requirements Specifications

POST: A request method that allows for the transfer of data via HTTP headers

IOS: I Operating System (apple mobile device software)

SQL: Structured Query Language. A language used for managing data held in a relational database system. 

1.4 References
This SRS document is based on IEEE Std 830-1998.

1.5 Overview
The remainder of the document contains details on the functionality and appearance of SnapChef.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective
SnapChef is an app with two major components. There is a frontend interface for the user to interact with, and database containing recipes.

2.2 Product Functions
	SnapChef is a mobile application. Users will input the ingredients they they have on hand and mark down any dietary restrictions they may have. They will be able to upload their ingredients in three ways. They can input as text, scan the barcode on the packaging or take a picture and let the appâ€™s algorithm determine the ingredients.The app will then give pull a recipe matching those ingredients and restrictions.

2.3 User Characteristics
	Generally, our users will be on a budget and not experienced with cooking
2.4 Constraints
Fake Recipes / Marketing Spam
only for modern android and ios devices
Requires access to camera
Requires internet connectivity
Needs to rely on others for recipes in message boards
Cost restraint


2.5 Assumptions and dependencies
internet connection
Peer review
Responsible imagery
Device has camera


3. Technical Requirements

3.1 External Interfaces
** based on GUI**

3.2 Performance requirements
Android Version: ____
iOS Version: ___
**depending on teams to decide which version they want to build for**

3.3 Security
The SnapChef app will be robust against SQL injection. This will be accomplished by parameterizing any input that is passed into the SQL statement. As well as opening and closing php connection for querying against the database.  

3.4 Portability
There will be an Android and iOS version. There will be shared text input, barcode, ML and recommendation api. If we wanted to expand, then will only need to create a new frontend

3.5 Data Storage
	All of the recipes will be stored in a MySQL Database. MySQL was chosen because of its ability to connect to both IOS and Android applications. There will be a single table containing the recipes. The table will include various columns such as Name, Ingredients, Dietary Restrictions etc. We will query the database through PHP scripts which implement the POST method.

4. Interface Requirements
We will be attempting to make the application on both platforms as similar as possible however due to the differences they experience in both code and hardware, some differences may occur.

5. Versions
	#0.1 Presented in class on Monday
