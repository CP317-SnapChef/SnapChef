        <li>3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities</li>
        
          <p>SnapChefs Objective is to make it simpler to cook at home provided what you have. The top priority of this project is to have a working demo before the final deadline (2018/12/08). Other priorities include the ability to properly read and write documentation through a set standard making the flow of the project move more smoothly, as well as learn better ways to approach future ambitions.</p>
        
        <li>3.2 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</li>
          
          <p>Meetings will be scheduled Mondays and Wednesdays after class in order to provide a progress update from each subgroup, as well as an opportunity to ask either for suggestions from those in a different mindset or add input on others progress. The use of a messaging tool, known as Slack, is used for subgroups to communicate in separate conversations and the group as a whole to provide input on any work that would require it. Testing and SQA is an open concept where everyone in the group has the opportunity to check for any issues that may be seen in any documentation, usually those in the same subgroup would check for issues and those outside of the subgroup would give an outsider’s perspective.
